		<h2 class="titoloL2">localhost</h2>
		<p id="par1">
			In computer networking,
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Localhost">localhost</a> is a
			hostname that refers to the current computer used to access it. It
			is used to access the network services that are running on the host
			via the loopback network interface. Using the loopback interface
			bypasses any local <strong>network</strong> interface hardware.
		</p>

		<h2 class="titoloL2">Loopback</h2>
		<p id="par2">
			The local <strong>loopback</strong> mechanism may be used to run a
			network service on a host without requiring a physical network
			interface, or without making the service accessible from the
			networks the computer may be connected to. For example, a locally
			installed website may be accessed from a Web browser by the URL
			http://localhost to display its home page. The name localhost
			normally resolves to the <abbr>IPv4</abbr>
			<small>loopback</small> address 127.0.0.1, and to the
			<abbr>IPv6</abbr> loopback address ::1.
		</p>
		<img src="./Girone_files/internet.jpg" alt="Rete" />

		<h2 class="titoloL2">Name resolution</h2>
		<p id="par3">
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4">IPv4</a> network
			standards reserve the entire address block 127.0.0.0/8 (more than 16
			million addresses) for loopback purposes.[2] That means any packet
			sent to any of those addresses is looped back. The address 127.0.0.1
			is the standard address for IPv4 loopback traffic; the rest are not
			supported by all operating systems. However, they can be used to set
			up multiple server applications on the host, all listening on the
			same port number. The IPv6 standard assigns only a single address
			for loopback: ::1. The <strong>resolution</strong> of the name
			<small>localhost</small> to one or more
			<q
				>IP addresses is normally configured by the following lines in
				the operating system's hosts file:</q
			>
			127.0.0.1 localhost ::1 <em>localhost</em>
		</p>

		<p id="par4">
			The name may also be resolved by <cite>Domain Name System</cite>
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System">(DNS)</a>
			servers, but queries for this name should be resolved locally, and
			should not be forwarded to remote name servers.
		</p>

		<p></p>
		<blockquote>
			In addition to the mapping of <u>localhost</u> to the loopback
			addresses (127.0.0.1 and ::1)
		</blockquote>
		, localhost may also be mapped to other IPv4 (loopback) addresses and it
		is also possible to assign other, or additional, names to any loopback
		address. The mapping of localhost to addresses other than the designated
		loopback address range in the hosts file or in DNS is not guaranteed to
		have the desired effect, as applications may map the name internally.
		<p></p>

		<p id="par5">
			In the <mark>Domain</mark> Name System, the name
			<mark>localhost</mark> is reserved as a <u>top-level</u> domain
			name, originally set aside to avoid confusion with the hostname used
			for loopback purposes.[3] IETF standards prohibit domain name
			registrars from assigning the name localhost.
		</p>

		<h2 class="titoloL2">IETF standards</h2>
		<div style="background-color: blue; color: white">
			<p>
				The name <small>localhost</small> is reserved for loopback
				<del>purposes</del> by <small>RFC</small> 6761 (Special-Use
				Domain Names),[4] which achieved the Proposed Standard maturity
				level in February 2013. The standard sets forth a number of
				special considerations governing the use of the name in the
				Domain Name System:
			</p>
		</div>
		<p id="par6">
			An <abbr>IPv4</abbr> or
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6">IPv6</a> address query
			for the name <u>localhost</u> must always resolve to the respective
			loopback address, which is specified in a separate standard.
			<span style="color: red">Applications</span> may resolve the name to
			<q
				>a loopback address themselves, or pass it to the local name
				resolver mechanisms.</q
			>
			When a name resolver receives an address
			<strong>(A or AAAA)</strong> <mark>query</mark> for
			<s>localhost</s>, it should return the <s>appropriate</s> loopback
			addresses, and negative responses for any other requested record
			types. <ins>Queries</ins> for localhost should not be sent to
			caching name servers. To avoid burdening the Domain
			<mark>Name</mark> System root servers with <s>traffic</s>, caching
			name servers should never request name <u>server</u> records for
			localhost, or forward resolution to authoritative name servers.
			<b>DNS</b> registrars are precluded from delegating domain names in
			the top-level domain <u>localhost</u>. When authoritative name
			servers receive <strong>queries</strong> for
			<span style="color: blue">'localhost'</span> in spite of the
			provisions mentioned resolve them appropriately. The
			<em>IPv4</em> loopback addresses are <del>reserved</del> within the
			<b>IPv4</b> address space by the IETF "Special Use IPv4 Addresses"
			<s>standard</s> (RFC 5735).[5] The reservation can be traced back to
			the <ins>November 1986</ins> "Assigned Numbers" standard (RFC
			<sup>990</sup>).
		</p>
		<img src="./Girone_files/ipAddress.png" alt="ipAddress" />
		<div style="background-color: blue; color: white">
			<p>
				In contrast, the <i>IETF</i> "IP Version 6 Addressing
				Architecture" <em>standard</em> (RFC 4291) reserves the single
				<u>IPv6</u> loopback address ::1 within the IPv6 address space.
				The standard precludes the assignment of that address to any
				physical interface, as well as its use as the source or
				destination address in any packet sent to remote hosts. Any such
				packet that is erroneously transmitted is not supposed to be
				routed, and should be dropped by all routers or hosts that
				receive it.
			</p>
		</div>
		<h2 class="titoloL2">Packet processing</h2>
		<p id="par7">
			The processing of any <span style="color: green">packet</span> sent
			to a loopback address, is implemented in the link layer of the
			TCP/IP stack. Such packets are never passed to any
			<ins>network</ins> interface controller (NIC) or hardware device
			driver and must not appear outside of a computing system, or be
			routed by any <i>router</i>. This permits software testing and local
			services in the absence of any hardware network interfaces.
		</p>

		<p id="par8">
			<i>Looped-back</i> packets are <del>distinguished</del> from any
			other <b>packets</b> traversing the <u>TCP/IP</u> stack only by the
			special IP address they were addressed to. Thus, the services that
			ultimately receive them respond according to the specified
			destination. For example, an HTTP service could route packets
			addressed to 127.0.0.99:80 and 127.0.0.100:80 to different Web
			servers, or to a single server that returns different web pages. To
			simplify such testing, the hosts file may be configured to provide
			appropriate names for each address.
		</p>

		<p>
			Packets received on a <small>non-loopback</small>
			<span style="color: red">interface</span> with a loopback source or
			<s>destination</s> address must be dropped. Such packets are
			sometimes <ins>referred</ins> to as Martian packets.<sub>[6]</sub>
			As with any other bogus packets, they may be malicious and any
			problems they might cause can be avoided by applying bogon
			filtering.
		</p>

		<h2 class="titoloL2">special cases</h2>

		<p>
			The releases of the <a href="https://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a>
			<em>database</em>
			<q
				>differentiate between the use of the
				<u>hostname</u> localhost </q
			>and the use of the addresses 127.0.0.1 and ::1.[7] When using
			<ins>localhost</ins> as the destination in a client connector
			interface of an application, the MySQL application programming
			interface connects to the <i>database</i> using a Unix domain
			socket, while a TCP connection via the loopback interface requires
			the direct use of the explicit address.

		</a>
		<p>
			One <mark>notable</mark> <em>exception</em> to the use of the
			<span style="color: blue">127.0.0.0/8</span> <b>addresses</b> is
			their use in <b>Multiprotocol</b> Label Switching (MPLS) traceroute
			<del>error</del> detection, in which their <del>property</del> of
			not being routable provides a convenient means to avoid delivery of
			faulty packets to end <i>users</i>.
